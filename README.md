**AgriTech** is an AI-powered smart agriculture platform designed to assist farmers with crop
recommendations, yield prediction, plant disease detection, and community-driven collaboration—enabling sustainable and data-driven farming practices.

---

## 📌 Overview

- AI-driven decision support for modern agriculture
- Early-stage plant disease detection
- Crop yield forecasting using machine learning models
- Collaborative ecosystem for farmers and stakeholders

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omroy07/AgriTech.git
cd AgriTech
```

### 2️⃣ Run Backend (Primary – Flask)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Backend URL:**

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

**🔍 Backend Health Check**

```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Expected response:**

```bash

### Backend vs Frontend

- **Backend** (`app.py` at root): Flask server handling APIs, Firebase config
- **Frontend** (`src/frontend/`): Static HTML/CSS/JS served via Python HTTP server
- **Optional Node Server** (`server.js`): Alternative chat backend (not required)

---

## 🔐 Security & Reliability

- Image sanitization using OpenCV
- Secrets stored in `.env` files
- ML models evaluated using standard performance metrics (accuracy varies by model and dataset)

---

For production use, run the backend with a WSGI server like [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/):

```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn app:app
```

---

## 🔑 API Keys Guide

- **Gemini API Key:** [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) se generate karein.
- **Firebase Keys:** [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) se apne project ke liye keys lein.
- API keys ko `.env` file me store karein (kabhi bhi repo me commit na karein).

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Fixes

- ❌ **ModuleNotFoundError**
  👉 Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- ❌ **Firebase config error**
  👉 Ensure `.env` values match Firebase Console

- ❌ **CORS issue**
  👉 Make sure backend runs before frontend

- ❌ **Port already in use**
  👉 Change port in `app.py` or stop previous process

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: The project is not running. What should I do?**
A: Make sure all Python dependencies are installed, the .env file is properly configured, and the correct API keys are being used.

**Q: How do I get a Gemini/Firebase API key?**
A: Refer to the “API Keys Guide” section above for step-by-step instructions.

**Q: I am seeing the warning “This is a development server…” on the Flask server. What does it mean?**
A: This server is intended only for development. For production, use a WSGI server such as Gunicorn.

**Q: I accidentally pushed my .env file. What should I do?**
A: Immediately rotate/regenerate your API keys, remove the .env file from Git tracking, add it to .gitignore, and clean the repository history if required.

**Q: The /health endpoint is not responding. What could be wrong?**
A: Ensure the backend server is running correctly and that the /health route is properly implemented.
